        <p class="p">In the assignment we were asked to design an app that would help one of the seventeen Global Goals which include Life Below Water which is where I focused my attention. My app was designed to be an addictive game where users can build their very ow coral reef in order to help save the ocean. The reef starts out sad and dying and as you play and build it slowly becomes more alive and vibrant and you can eventually get tourists to come visit your reef in order to make more money. The coins and pearls in the game are where you can donate money towards saving the ocean in order to receive more coins which therefor allows you to build a bigger better reef.</p>

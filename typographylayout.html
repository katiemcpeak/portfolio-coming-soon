<div class="description">
	<p>This type layout was supposed to be a way of thinking outside of the box. Instead of using our usual grids we were told to break the grid and make a different style of layout that still held to the other usual typeographic rules. The artical was about race car drivers and their obssesion with speed so I made the layout look slightly like a set of tire streaks and have a line going across to indicate movement across the page.</p>

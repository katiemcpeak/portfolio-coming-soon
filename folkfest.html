<div class="description">
	<p>This poster was designed for music festivals. We had creative freedom for what event we wanted to design for, we only had instructions to design a poster an upcoming event. I drew everything from scratch excpet the date, website and location that is underneath the title. I then scanned and worked in Illustrator to make the rest of the poster.</p>

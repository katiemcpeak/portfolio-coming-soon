        <p class="p">We were given the task of designing a new typface for this project. We had to come up with something entirely different and work with the Glyphs App to design the typeface. I wanted to make my typeface geometrical and cosmic. Because of this theme the posters I designed followed suit. The phases of the moon and different objects such as a comet and a shooting star influenced my design.</p>

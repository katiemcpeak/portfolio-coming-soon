                <p class="p">In this piece I took a photo from Hawaii and took the time to make each small colour change within the image an actual section with the different colours. It is dynamic and could be used for different forms of merchandise such as cellphone cases, t-shirts, laptop covers and posters. Hawaii is my dream destination; having been there twice I can honestly say it is paradise on earth.</p>
